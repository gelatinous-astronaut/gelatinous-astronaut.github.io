          <p>I have a PhD in Computational Cosmology and I currently work for the University of Arizona's High Performance Computing Center supporting and training researchers in computational techniques. I also make digital art using (mainly python) code &amp; GIMP, shoot 35mm film photography, and write/record/produce/perform music of many genres. You can find all of these things here!

          <p>This website is my attempt to unify my personal and professional interests. My separate interests in science and the arts have never actually been all that separate. I studied astrophysics because of the sense of wonder that uncovering patterns of nature evokes. I do film photography, write music, and make digital art for more or less the same reason.</p>

          <p>During my PhD I studyied the formation of dwarf galaxies using computational methods, with a focus on disentangling the predictions of our cosmological models and galaxy formation physics, as well as on making predictions for the next generation of telescopes, including James Webb, which is now online. I have three publications which you can find and read for free <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_database%7D&fq_database=database%3A%20astronomy&q=author%3A(%22%5Ejahn%2C%20ethan%22)&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0">here</a>.

          <p>Why is my website.. like <i>this?</i></p>

          <p>The clean and polished aesthetics of the modern web make me sad and bored. I also think it removes the personal aspect from science and science communication. The public wants to know that science is done by people just like them. Or at least by real people. Being curious and colorful and fun is relatable! Scientific literacy is one of the biggest social issues we face. We need to show that science is done by real people and not shady conspiratorial entities. It's done by people who just want to find out more about the world we all share.</p>

          <p>I also want to show that science and art are not separate processes. Scientists can be creative and artists can be informed and inspired by science. The most exciting work being done right now is reaching across boundaries. Interdisciplinary scientific research is a part of that, but reaching across the boundaries of science itself into new realms is what expands our abilities to know our world and to know ourselves. Scientific knowledge is only one kind of knowledge. Giving recognition and legitimacy to other forms of knowledge strengthens them all.</p>
