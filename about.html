      <h2 style="font-size: 26px">Hello!</h2>

      <p>Hihihi my name is Ethan and I'm a scientist, artist, musician, teacher, climber, gardener, highly uninformed insect-enthusiast, walker, talker, friend, stranger, and colleague. Welcome to my website, I'm glad you found it!</p>

      <p>If you would like to know more about my academic and work experience, you can view my CV <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Unk8w48gD8D3D-GRhznjzEE3PcL7LgaCpJIe3CvcRIk/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. But just to cover the basics:</p>

      <!-- I studied astrophysics because of the sense of wonder that uncovering patterns of nature evokes. I do film photography, write music, and make digital art for more or less the same reason.</p> -->

      <p>I received my PhD from the UC Riverside department of Physics and Astronomy in September 2021. I used high resolution numerical simulations to study the physics of galaxy formation and its relevance to our cosmological models, including dark matter, including making predictions for the next generation of telescopes, including James Webb, which is now online. I have three publications which you can find and read for free <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_database%7D&fq_database=database%3A%20astronomy&q=author%3A(%22%5Ejahn%2C%20ethan%22)&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0">here</a>. You can see some animated movies and explanations of my research by clicking on this super cool button! </p>

      <p>After my PhD, I worked several different part-time adjunct teaching positions at various community colleges in Southern California. I am very passionate about teaching, and about making science accessible to everyone. I don't think I'm special for receiving a PhD in Astrophysics - I genuinely think that anyone who is curious and persistent can do equal or better work than mine. You can read more about my experience and pedagogy by clicking on this other super cool button!</p>

      Currently, I am a <i>Research Facilitator</i> at the University of Arizona's High Performance Computing center. This means I support and train researchers at all levels how to use the supercomputer. I answer questions, write <a href="https://hpcdocs.hpc.arizona.edu">documentation</a>, present training workshops, organize events, and think broadly about how to support and expand research computing. I think it's pretty neat! Right now I'm mostly focused on expanding our training workshops, and thinking about how to use HPC to facilitate more interdisciplinary research, including (especially) reaching the arts and humanities. If you have any thoughts on that I would absolutely love to hear them!!! Please email me at <a href="mailto:ejahn@arizona.edu">ejahn@arizona.edu</a>

      <h2 style="font-size: 26px">The Grand Unification Principle</h2>

      <p>This whole thing is my attempt to unify my personal and professional interests. My separate interests in science and the arts have never actually been all that separate. I didn't study astrophysics because I think it will someday be useful, or because I think humanity should flee our problems on Earth for a techno-utopia in the stars.. I did it because space is frickin cool and I liked learning and teaching about it. </p>

      <p>I'm also using this website as both a platform to showcase all different things I do in one place, and as a motivator for me to do more cool things to put on hear and watch it grow. </p>

      <p>The two things I am most excited to put together for this website are generative art projects in which I use code to create art, and simulations that explore (hopefully) interesting properties that emerge from systems built on simple rules. These are in-progress so check back later :)</p>

      <p>I also think it's important to include my other creative pursuits here partially as a portfolio and partially to break down the barriers (at least the ones in my head) between my "hobbies" and my professional work. Sure, I don't have the pedigree or formal training that many professional artists do, but I've been doing these things for a long time and hiding them seems frankly ridiculous at this point. Plus, with my interest in incorporating more humanities into computing, I think showing my creative works may be important, or something. I dunno! </p>
      
      <h2 style="font-size: 26px">Why is my website.. like <i>this?</i></h2>

      <p>The clean and polished aesthetics of the modern web make me sad and bored. I also think it removes the personal aspect from science and science communication. The public wants to know that science is done by people just like them. Or at least by real people. Being curious and colorful and fun is relatable! Since scientific literacy is one of the biggest social issues we face, it's important to show that science is done by regular folks with hobbies and interests rather than shady conspiratorial entities. Everyone shares a common curiosity and fascination with the natural world, and everyone has interests that don't fit neatly into nice little LinkedIn-friendly boxes. </p>

      <p>I also want to show that science and art are not separate processes. Scientists can be creative and artists can be informed and inspired by science. The most exciting work being done right now is reaching across boundaries. Interdisciplinary scientific research is a part of that, but reaching across the boundaries of science itself into new realms is what expands our abilities to know our world and to know ourselves. Scientific knowledge is only one kind of knowledge. Giving recognition and legitimacy to other forms of knowledge strengthens them all.</p>

      <h2 style="font-size: 26px">What is a <i>gelatinous astronaut?</i></h2>

      <p>The real answer is that it's an old username of mine that mashes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFZR1W5F8W0">a song I like</a> by Thee Oh Sees and my interest in astrophysics. I feel like it's somewhat representative of my mission here - unifying seemingly disparate interests.</p>

      <p>I also think it's possibly a good prompt for creative writing exercises in divergent thinking. Maybe someday I'll work on those and post them here.</p>
